This dashboard is made using only open source tools! The data is sourced from EPA's Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) 2018. It represents the performance characterisitics of almost all solar and wind electric power generated in the United States. Through this dasboard, we can manifest a powerful way of visualizing and analyzing interactive data. The visualizations below represent the relationship between the capacity factor and nameplate capacity (MW) of all solar and wind electric power stations. The histogram tells a deeper story around the distribution of capacity with increasing capacity factor. Hover over the data points to examine the metadata.
